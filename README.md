# PK2SDK
Technical documentation of the game Pekka Kana 2.

---

This project aims to document Pekka Kana 2's classes, files and other technical aspects. It will also include a library, in different programming languages, to make manipulation and creation of the games files easier. Furthermore, it aims to make it easier to maintain Pekka Kana 2 and make the creation of various tools (e.g. level editor, sprite editor) easier.


E.g.:
  * Level file format
  * Sprite file format
  * PK2 Save File
  * PK2 Graphics
  

The original source code is also provided under the "PK2Source" folder, as it was released by the original creator.
  
  
The information will be found on this projects wiki (Note: include link) and in the "doc" folder, as PDF files to download for offline use.

A collection of Java classes will be provided soon, by myself (Deta), but if you know any other programming language(s) you are very welcome to create libs in these.

You can also help compiling the information. Use the file "PK2Map.pdf" as a template.

This project takes it's information from the officially released source code ([Found here](http://pistegamez.proboards.com/thread/543/level-editor-source-codes-available)) and documents it. None of the information was reversed engineered or obtained in other ways.
